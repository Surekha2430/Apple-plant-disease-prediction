# Apple Plant Disease Prediction

This project predicts apple plant diseases using image classification.

# Project Description
This is a machine learning based project that detects apple leaf diseases using a trained CNN model.
The application is built using Python and Streamlit.

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- OpenCV

# Dataset
Apple leaf images dataset with different disease classes and healthy leaves.

# How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py

# Output
The model predicts whether the apple leaf is healthy or affected by a disease
# Note
The trained model file is not uploaded due to github file size limitations
